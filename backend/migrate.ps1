# Migration Summary

**Migration Date:** $(Get-Date)
**Status:** Completed Successfully

## What was migrated:
- MongoDB database to PostgreSQL
- Node.js/JavaScript to Node.js/TypeScript
- Mongoose ODM to Prisma ORM
- Enhanced security and audit logging

## Database Changes:
- **From:** MongoDB (Document-based)
- **To:** PostgreSQL (Relational)
- **Benefits:** ACID compliance, better data integrity, advanced querying

## New Features Added:
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Enhanced error handling
- Production-ready security
- Better relationship modeling

## API Endpoints:
- ``POST /api/auth/register`` - User registration
- ``POST /api/auth/login`` - User login
- ``GET /api/doctors`` - Get all doctors
- ``GET /api/appointments`` - Get appointments
- ``POST /api/appointments`` - Book appointment
- ``GET /api/patients/me/profile`` - Get patient profile

## Environment Variables:
Check your ``.env`` file for all configuration options.

## Next Steps:
1. Update your frontend to use the new API structure
2. Test all functionality thoroughly
3. Deploy to production environment
4. Set up monitoring and backups

## Backup Location:
Your original project is backed up at: $backupDir
